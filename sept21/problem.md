A knight was initially located in a square labeled 1. It then proceeded to make a series of moves, never re-visiting a square, and labeled the visited squares in order. When the knight was finished, the labeled squares in each region of connected squares1 had the same sum.

A short while later, many of the labels were erased. The remaining labels can be seen above.

Complete the grid by re-entering the missing labels.

The answer to this puzzle is the sum of the squares of the largest label in each row of the completed grid, as in the example.
